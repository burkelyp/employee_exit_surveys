# employee_exit_surveys
7th guided project with DataQuest.io

This project uses data from exit surveys from two different organizations: Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institutes in Australia.

The goal is to investigate correlations between satisfaction with the employer and characteristics of the employee

We found that the longer an employee worked in the industry or the older the employee was, the more likely they were to be disatisfied with their job
